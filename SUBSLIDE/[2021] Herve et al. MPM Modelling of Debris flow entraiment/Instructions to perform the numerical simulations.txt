1. Run the initialisation of the gravity load. Use artificial_damping_coeff=0.75 and start a simulation for 2s (6s for the EB simulation).
2. From the output, change artificial_damping_coeff to 0. Run the simulation for the desired duration of the flow.

CB refers to the curved barrier simulation
RB refers to the rectilinear barrier simulation
EB refers to the erodible bed simulation
