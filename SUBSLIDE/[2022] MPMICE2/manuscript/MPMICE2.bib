abstract = {The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in the simulation of geotechnical applications. Owing to the limitations of FEM to model problems involving large deformations, many efforts have been made to develop methods free of mesh entanglement. One of these methods is the Material Point Method (MPM) which models the material as Lagrangian particles capable of moving through a background computational mesh in Eulerian manner. Although MPM represents the continuum by material points, solution is performed on the computational mesh. Thus, imposing boundary conditions is not aligned with the material representation. In this paper, a non-zero kinematic condition is introduced where an additional set of particles is incorporated to track the moving boundary. This approach is then applied to simulate the seismic motion resulting in failure of slopes. To validate this simulation procedure, two geotechnical applications are modelled using MPM. The first is to reproduce a shaking table experiment where the results of another numerical method are available. After validating the present numerical scheme for relatively large deformation problem, it is applied to simulate progression of a large-scale landslide during the Chi-Chi earthquake of Taiwan in which excessive material deformation and transportation is taking place.}

    abstract = { Earthquake-triggered landslides have significant socio-economic impacts, claiming the lives of a third of the casualties associated with earthquakes due to their catastrophic runout. To improve the risk assessment and to mitigate the consequences of landslides due to seismic shaking, it is crucial to predict the initial triggering of mobilized mass (i.e., failure initiation) and to estimate the kinematics and postfailure final runout. While extensive work has been done in the field of earthquake engineering to address the small-strain failure initiation, the prediction of the kinematics and the final runout of earthquake-induced landslides have been less explored because of the complexities to simulate the shaking ground motion and the landslide event in a unified numerical framework. This paper presents the material point method (MPM) as a tool that is capable of simulating the landslide triggering and the whole instability process until its final runout. The use of a kinematic boundary condition applied to the nodes and a moving mesh technique is proposed to improve the efficiency of the calculation. A laboratory shaking table experiment is used for reference, and the MPM numerical results are compared to other nonlinear dynamic numerical approaches. Finally, a parametric analysis is conducted to understand the failure mechanics and emphasize the importance to further investigate the behavior of partially saturated soils subjected to dynamic loading. }
