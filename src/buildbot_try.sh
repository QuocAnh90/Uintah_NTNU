# The purpose of this script is to test changes you have made to your
# local git repository by shipping those changes to the Uintah
# buildbot server to run tests against.
#
# Before you can run this script, the "buildbot" package must be
# installed on your computer.
#
# - On Debian (as root) you can run: apt-get install buildbot
#
#
# This is an example of a successful submission:
